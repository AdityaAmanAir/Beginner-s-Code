# 4. A store manages its inventory using a dictionary. 
# Each product has a unique Product ID as the key, and its details like name, price, and stock are stored as a nested dictionary. 
# Implement the following operations using dictionary methods:
# 1. Add a New Product. 
# 2. Add the product - if already exists, use setdefault to ensure the price and stock have default values.
# 3. Check Product Availability using its Product ID.
# 4. List All Products with their details
# 5. Retrieve a Productâ€™s Price
# 6. Update the stock by increasing and decreasing the stock of a specific product.
# 7. Remove a Product using its Product ID.
# 8. Clear Inventory
