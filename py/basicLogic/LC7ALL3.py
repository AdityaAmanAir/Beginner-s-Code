# Write a program that performs slicing operations.
# Extract elements using positive indices
# Extract elements using negative indices
# Slicing with step
# Reverse the entire tuple using slicing
# Slice from start to a specific index
# Slice from a specific index to the end
# Slice the entire tuple (no slicing arguments)
# (Hint: my_tuple[:])
# Extract the last 'n' elements using slicing
# Extract the first 'n' elements using slicing
# Combining slicing with unpacking
# Display Odd-index elements
# Display Even-index elements
# Extract a subset of the reversed tuple

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4,"Aman", 3.1415926,True,-100,False,-99)
print(my_tuple[3:8])

print(my_tuple[-5-2])
