/* In just a simple word : we store negative numbers in different way because the old system was not fitting with the calculation!! :) 2nd reaseon was the old system also had a problem of +0 and -0;

1st -- Define the number of bits , eg 1,2,3,4,etc..
2nd -- Define the 1st most bit ... example : lets us define a 5 bit -> _ _ _ _ _ -> the first most (MSB) will be reserved for sign , which means only 4 bits are mathematicaly operatable, 0 = + and 1 = - for the 1st bit. eg is 01010 i.e 10 in decimal 
3rd -- Inter change the bits value i.e. 1 to 0 and 0 to 1, eg -> 01010 become 10101
4th -- add +1 to it eg. -> 10101 becomes 10110
10110 is  -10 in decimal

NOTE ### 
if -10 was not 5 in bit, then the vales whould be different 
if it was 8 bit system then the vale of -10 would have = 11110101

MY LOGIC ###
The scientist just inverted the order of number i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 = 0,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 respectively 

given below will make it clear :-
